# RepoXplorer

RepoXplorer is a stats and charts utility for Git repositories. Its main
purpose is to ease the visualization of stats for projects composed of one
or multiple Git repositories. Indeed lot of projects are splitted and have
a Git repository by components (server, client, library A, ...) and most of
classic Git stat tools do not handle that.

RepoXplorer let's you describe how a project is composed and then computes
stats across them. RepoXplorer provides a Web user interface based on Bootstrap
and Jquery to let a user access data easily. It relies on ElasticSearch for
its data backend.

## How to install

Last release is RepoXplorer [0.7.2](https://github.com/morucci/repoxplorer/releases/tag/0.7.2).

### All In One Docker container

Comming soon.

### RPM installation for CentOS 7

RepoXplorer has been packaged for CentOS 7 with EPEL7 repository activated. It is
not in the official EPEL7 repositories but rpm and src.rpm are available.

Here is the process to follow:

First install the EPEL7 repository.

```Shell
sudo yum install epel-release
```

Install ElasticSearch 2.x for CentOS via rpm:

```Shell
sudo rpm --import https://packages.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repo.d/elasticsearch.repo
[elasticsearch-2.x]
name=Elasticsearch repository for 2.x packages
baseurl=https://packages.elastic.co/elasticsearch/2.x/centos
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
EOF
sudo yum install elasticsearch java-1.8.0-openjdk
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
```

Finally install RepoXplorer:

```Shell
sudo yum install https://github.com/morucci/repoxplorer/releases/download/0.7.2/repoxplorer-0.7.2-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
# Fetch needed web assets (JQuery, JQuery-UI, Bootstrap, ...)
sudo /usr/bin/repoxplorer-fetch-web-assets -p /usr/share/repoxplorer/public/
# Enable and start services
sudo systemctl enable repoxplorer
sudo systemctl enable repoxplorer-webui
sudo systemctl start repoxplorer
sudo systemctl start repoxplorer-webui
```

Then open a Web browser to access http://localhost:51000

projects.yaml and idents.yaml are available in /etc/repoxplorer. Please
then follow the [Configuration section](#configuration).

### Install in a python virtualenv

```Shell
virtualenv ~/repoxplorer
. ~/repoxplorer/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
./bin/repoxplorer-fetch-web-assets
```

An Elasticsearch instance is needed and repoXplorer will try to access it
default at 127.0.0.1.

Here, we use a "ready to use" Docker container for Elasticsearch.
But you should definitely use a regular installation of ElasticSearch.

```Shell
~/repoxplorer/bin/el-start.sh
```

Start the RepoXplorer web UI.

```Shell
uwsgi --http-socket :51000 --pecan /home/<user>/repoxplorer/local/share/repoxplorer/config.py \
 --static-map /css=/home/<user>/repoxplorer/local/share/repoxplorer/public/css \
 --static-map /javascript=/home/<user>/repoxplorer/local/share/repoxplorer/public/javascript \
 --static-map /images=/home/<user>/repoxplorer/local/share/repoxplorer/public/images
```

Then open a Web browser to access http://localhost:51000

Start the RepoXplorer indexer

```Shell
python ~/repoxplorer/bin/repoxplorer-indexer
```

In order to run the indexer continuously you can use the command
argument "--forever".

#### Install systemd unit file for the web UI

You can install the systemd unit file for the web UI.
Be sure to set the correct path to the uwsgi tool, the config.py file
and web assets as this unit file expect repoXplorer installed outside
of a virtualenv.

```
sudo cp etc/repoxplorer-webui.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/repoxplorer-webui.service

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start repoxplorer-webui
sudo systemctl status repoxplorer-webui

# You can check the webui log via journalctl
sudo journalctl -f
```

#### Install systemd unit file for the indexer

```
sudo cp etc/repoxplorer.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/repoxplorer.service
# Be sure to set the correct path to the repoxplorer-indexer script

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start repoxplorer
sudo systemctl status repoxplorer

# You can check the indexer log via journalctl
sudo journalctl -f
```

## Configuration

If RepoXplorer has been installed via its setup.py then
replace /etc/repoxplorer to $install-prefix/local/share/repoxplorer/.

### How to index a list of Git hosted projects

Below is an example of projects.yaml, note that Barbican and Swift projects
are composed of two Git repositories, the server and the client.

Edit /etc/repoxplorer/projects.yaml to add projects you want to index.

```YAML
---
project-templates:
  default:
    uri: https://github.com/openstack/%(name)s
    branches:
    - master
    - stable/mitaka
    - stable/newton
    - stable/ocata
    gitweb: https://github.com/openstack/%(name)s/commit/%%(sha)s

projects:
  Barbican:
    barbican:
      template: default
    python-barbicanclient:
      template: default
  Swift:
    swift:
      template: default
    python-swiftclient:
      template: default
```

After a change in this file you can start the Git indexer manually or
let the indexer daemon reads the file (every minute) and handles changes.

#### Advanced configuration

The branches key of a template definition permits to defines which
branches to index. This key expects a list of branches name.

A list of tags can be given to each Git repositories. This tag concept
should not be considered as Git tags but only as a way to mark
Git repositories. For example tags like 'documentation', 'librairies',
packaging, ...) could be considered. Tags defined at repositories level
will be appended to those defined at the template level.

```YAML
project-templates:
  default:
    uri: https://github.com/openstack/%(name)s
    branches:
    - master
    tags:
    - openstack

projects:
  MyProject:
    myrepo:
      templates: default
      tags:
      - language:python
```

A list of releases can be defined. It is useful when you want to define
release dates across all repositories defined in a project.
Release dates with %m/%d/%Y format can be defined and will be merged with
detected Git tags dates.

```YAML
project-templates:
  default:
    uri: https://github.com/openstack/%(name)s
    branches:
      - master
    releases:
      - name: 2.0
        date: 12/20/2016

projects:
  MyProject:
    myrepo:
      template: default
```

It is also possible to define metadata parsers. Please refer to
the [Metadata automatic indexation section](#metadata-automatic-indexation).

### Sanitize author identities

It often happens authors use mulitple identities (multiple emails) when
they contribute to a project. You can use the file idents.yaml to define
emails that belong to a contributor. RepoXplorer will use that file to
group contributions with multiple emails under a single identity.

In the example below contributions from both author emails 'john.doe@server'
and 'jdoe@server' will be stacked for John Doe.

Edit /etc/repoxplorer/idents.yaml

```YAML
---
identities:
  0000-0000:
    name: John Doe
    default-email: john.doe@server
    emails:
      john.doe@server:
        groups: {}
      jdoe@server:
        groups: {}
```

### Metadata automatic indexation

In addition to the standard Git object fields, the indexer will detect
metadata such as:

- close-bug: #123
- implement-feature: bp-new-scheduler

All "key: value" that match the following default regex will be indexed:

```
'^([a-zA-Z-0-9_-]+):([^//].+)$'
```

Furthermore in projects.yaml it is possible to specify
custom capturing regexs to extract metadata that does not
follow to the default regex.

All regexs specified in the *parsers* key will be executed on
each commit message line. You need to have two captured elements
and the first one will be used as the key the second one as
the value.

```YAML
project-templates:
  default:
    uri: https://github.com/openstack/%(name)s
    branches:
    - master
    gitweb: https://github.com/openstack/%(name)s/commit/%%(sha)s
    parsers:
    - .*(blueprint) ([^ .]+).*
```
Custom capturing regexs must be defined prior to the indexation
of the Git repository it apply.

## Use the commits.json REST endpoint to query the internal DB

This endpoint is used by the UI to fetch commits listing according
to the filters you have setup in the UI but the endpoint can be also used
outside of the UI. Here are some examples about how to use it:

```Shell
# Return all commits from repositories included in the designate project
curl "http://localhost:51000/commits.json?pid=designate"

# Return all commits from repositories included into the designate project that
# have a metadata "Closes-bug" (whatever the field value)
curl "http://localhost:51000/commits.json?pid=designate&metadata=Closes-Bug:*"

# Return all commits from all repositories that have the
# metadata "implement-feature" that match "bp-new-scheduler"
curl "http://localhost:51000/commits.json?metadata=implement-feature:bp-new-scheduler"

# Return all commits from all repositories that have the
# metadata "implement-feature" that match "bp-new-scheduler" or
# "implement" that match "bp-new-scheduler"
curl "http://localhost:51000/commits.json?metadata=implement-feature:bp-new-scheduler,implement:bp-new-scheduler"
```

Available arguments are:
- fromdate: epoch
- todate: epoch
- limit: amount of result returned by page (default: 10)
- start: page cursor
- pid: project name as configured in projects.yaml
- tid: tag as configured in the projects.yaml
- cid: contributor id
